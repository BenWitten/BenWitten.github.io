  <p> My first internship in marketing required me to dress up as a giant tortilla chip on occasion. Working for a company that utilized silly, off-the-wall promotions to compete against industry titans and win is what first piqued my interest in marketing and business. This experience inspired me to pursue startups. Working with new and growing companies that need to find a way to tackle the giants is the most fun to me. After a variety of marketing internships, more recently Iâ€™ve had opportunities to be director of those efforts.  </p>
  <p> While studying for my MBA, I was Marketing Director of a startup ecommerce toy company and also served as CEO of my own startup, an events company in the Rochester area. For both, I studied the industries, determined the market and value proposition that would help the companies succeed, and molded the companies to take those markets. 
</p>
<p> I am currently at the Startup Institute, polishing my Technical Marketing skills and getting exposure to the NYC start-up community. At the end of the program, I will be seeking a marketing strategist/analyst role at a tech startup where I can leverage my education and experience to drive growth. </p>
